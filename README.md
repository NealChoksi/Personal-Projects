# Personal-Projects
# The purpose of this project is to create an iMessage app that allows the owner of the iPhone to type out 
# messages to be sent at a later time.


# For example, my sister's birthday is on Tuesday and I want to send her a Happy Birthday text. However,
# I'll be on a plane for the majority of the day. I can use l8r to type out my message to her and program
# a specific time for the text message to be sent out.
